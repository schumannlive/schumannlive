# 🌍 Schumannlive Twitter bot 🌍

I made this little buddy because at the time there was no other twitter bot posting live schumanns.

## How to make it work:

1. Provide your Twitter API keys in config.js (you need a twitter developers account tied to the account you want to post from, and have to create a write/read app to get them)

2. Run **npm install** in the directory you put your bot in

3. Run tweetbot.js by typing **node tweetbot.js**

Bot will automatically download graphs and post them accordingly to the settings from 14th to 36th line of tweetbot.js - you can tune russiarules (Tomsk), italyrules (Cumiana) and italy2rules (Romagna) to your liking.

*you have to have node installed on your machine*
